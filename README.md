# Hipster Invaders


## Introduction

Welcome to Hipster Invaders! A South Park inspired game, where you play Coon (Cartman) and attempt to stave off the impending wave of hipsterdom into the city, using only hotdogs at your disposal! Will Souht Park become engulfed into world of Whole Foods' and Sur le Tables' or will Coon prevent the invasion? Enjoy...

## Description and user story

A very simple and straightforward concept. Made entirely with vannilla js, HTML 5 and CSS this take on Space Invaders is updated for our cartoon era. There are only three controls to move Coon. The left and right arrows move Coon left and right and make sure not to move him off screen or you will lose! Space bar fires your arsenal of hotdogs at the hipsters and if you hit all the hipsters you save South Park from invasion! So aim high!
